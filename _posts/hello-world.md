## Lorem Ipsum

First of all, if you have in your possession an old map which is marked with the exact places where something is buried, then you are very lucky! .

There may be a few problems with reading certain symbols on the map because the author of this map has drawn some of his own symbols which mark obstacles, traps, holes, rivers and the main symbol where the treasure is buried.

These symbols can easily confuse the seeker and in the worst case even cost him his life, because he did not know where a trap was placed. And believe me, everyone who buried something valuable, also set up a trap or at least an obstacle of some kind that protects that something from a potential thief.
Below I will explain the meaning of some symbols which may be useful to you.

The first symbol is the scorpion, which is usually associated with danger.
If a river, hole, or a cellar is drawn next to a scorpion, then it does not represent danger. Then you should pay attention to the position of the tail, whether it is raised or horizontal is an indicator of the way. Also pay attention to the size of the pincers. If one side is larger, that's the right direction and usually indicates a tunnel that further splits into two. The right way to the treasure is the one where the pincers are larger.

Another symbol is a fish, which indicates the exact location of the treasure. If this is the symbol in question then look around at the nearest river, stream or lake. But if the symbol has two fish, then the treasure is located between the two water sources.

The third symbol is the ring, which scares the seekers the most, because it usually indicates the possible danger of poison. In most cases, the gold is poisoned or the cave is poisoned and you should be careful and take protective measures before entering the cave or digging.

The fourth symbol, the tooth, indicates a narrow passage or a place where u should dig.

The fifth symbol is the cross, which usually indicates the sides of the world, and the direction of the treasure which is to the east. If there are lines on it, it shows that there is gold located in that place above it, but there are also many traps and deadly poisons.
